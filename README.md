#  Mass Spectrum Predictor

This repository contains implementations for the following spectrum simulator models predicting molecular tandem mass spectra from molecules: 

- 🧊 ICEBERG 🧊️: [Inferring CID by Estimating Breakage Events and Reconstructing their Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13136) (now available to run through [GNPS2](https://gnps2.org/workflowinput?workflowname=3DMolMS_smiles_to_spectra))
- 🏃‍ MARASON 🏃‍: [Neural Graph Matching Improves Retrieval Augmented Generation in Molecular Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.17874) (Code merging WIP)
- 🧣 SCARF 🧣: [Subformula Classification for Autoregressively Reconstructing Fragmentations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06470)

ICEBERG predicts spectra at the level of molecular fragments, whereas SCARF predicts spectra at the level of chemical formula. In order to fairly compare various spectra models, we implement a number of baselines and alternative models using equivalent settings across models (i.e., same covariates, hyeprparmaeter sweeps for each, etc.):

## Install & setup <a name="setup"></a>

Install and set up the conda environment using [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):

```
mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba activate ms-gen
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py develop
```
Note: if you are not using GPU, please comment the CUDA-based packages in ``envorinment.yaml``.

## Data <a name="data"></a>

> We are retiring the support of the NPLIB1 dataset (also referred as CANOPUS sometimes) in the main branch. 
> You can checkout to the [``iceberg_analychem_2024`` branch](https://github.com/coleygroup/ms-pred/tree/iceberg_analychem_2024)
> with the legacy code that supports NPLIB1.

``nist20`` is a commercial dataset available for purchase through [several vendors worldwide](https://chemdata.nist.gov/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=chemdata:distributors).
Given the scale of effort required to purchase samples, run experiments, and collect such a large amount of spectra,
and that NIST’20 is the only database where all spectra have collision energy annotations, this dataset is a reasonable investment in mass spectrum-related research in the
absence of a thorough open-source replacement. 

After your purchase of NIST, export the raw data as ``.SDF``. A detailed instruction on NIST'20 could be found [here](https://github.com/Roestlab/massformer?tab=readme-ov-file#exporting-the-nist-data) 
(select ``.SDF`` in output format). The code to process raw data could be found at ``reformat_nist_lcmsms_sdf.py`` in [this repo](https://github.com/rogerwwww/ms-data-parser).
Once the dataset is processed, move the files to ``ms-pred/data/spec_datasets/nist20`` and make sure it looks like
```
└── nist20
    ├── labels.tsv
    ├── mgf_files
    ├── spec_files.hdf5
    └── splits
```


### SCARF Processing

Data should then be assigned to subformulae files using
`data_scripts/forms/assign_subformulae.py`, which will preprocess the data. We
produce two fragment versions of the molecule, `magma_subform_50` and
`no_subform`. The former strictly labels subformula based upon smiles structure
and the latter is permissive and allows all entries to pass.

```
. data_scripts/all_assign_subform.sh
```


### ICEBERG Processing

In addition to building processed subformulae, to train ICEBERG, we must
annotate substructures and create a labeled dataset over the breakage process, 
which we do with the MAGMa algorithm.

This can be done with the following script, specifying an appropriate dataset:

```

. data_scripts/dag/run_magma.sh

```


### Retrieval

To conduct retrieval experiments, libraries of smiles must be created. A PubChem
library is converted and each chemical formula is mapped to (smiles, inchikey)
pairs. Subsets are selected for evaluation.  Making formula subsets takes longer
(on the order of several hours, even parallelized) as it requires converting
each molecule in PubChem to a mol / InChI. 

```

source data_scripts/pubchem/01_download_smiles.sh
python data_scripts/pubchem/02_make_formula_subsets.py
python data_scripts/pubchem/03_dataset_subset.py --dataset-labels data/spec_datasets/nist20/labels.tsv # for nist20 dataset
python data_scripts/pubchem/04_make_retrieval_lists.py

```

 
## Experiments <a name="experiments"></a>

### ICEBERG

ICEBERG is our recommended model with a 40% top-1 retrieval accuracy with [M+H]+, benchmarked on the NIST'20 dataset. 
ICEBERG is trained in two parts: a learned fragment generator and an intensity predictor. The pipeline for training and evaluating this model can be accessed in `run_scripts/iceberg/`. 
There is an all-in-one script ``run_scripts/iceberg/run_all.sh`` that trains the up-to-date version of ICEBERG on NIST'20 dataset described in Wang et al. (2025). 
The archived version released with [Goldman et al. (2024)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13136) is at the [``iceberg_analychem_2024`` branch](https://github.com/coleygroup/ms-pred/tree/iceberg_analychem_2024).
The internal pipeline used to conduct experiments can be followed below:

1. *Train dag model*: `run_scripts/iceberg/01_run_dag_gen_train.sh`   
2. *Sweep over the number of fragments to generate*: `run_scripts/iceberg/02_sweep_gen_thresh.py`     
3. *Use model 1 to predict model 2 training set*: `run_scripts/iceberg/03_run_dag_gen_predict.sh`   
4. *Train intensity model, including contrastive training*: `run_scripts/iceberg/04_train_dag_inten.sh`   
5. *Make and evaluate intensity predictions*: `run_scripts/iceberg/05_predict_dag_inten.py`  
6. *Run retrieval*: `run_scripts/iceberg/06_run_retrieval.py`

> The above scripts will only run for split_1_rnd1 (random split, seed=1), which is suitable if you want to train your own ICEBERG for structural elucidation applications.
> 
> If you want to replicate our reported result with random + scaffold splits and 3 random seeds, please uncomment
> all entries in the following files
> * ``configs/iceberg/*.yaml``
> * ``02_sweep_gen_thresh.py``
> * ``05_predict_dag_inten.py``
> * ``06_run_retrieval.py``

> You need two GPUs with at least 24GB RAM to train ICEBERG (we used NVIDIA A5000 for development). If you are trying to
> train the model on a smaller GPU, try cutting down the batch size and skipping the contrastive 
> finetuning step. Note that changing training parameters will affect the model's performance.

Instead of running in batched pipeline model, individual gen training, inten
training, and predict calls can be  made using the following scripts respectively:

1. `python src/ms_pred/dag_pred/train_gen.py`
2. `python src/ms_pred/dag_pred/train_inten.py`
3. `python src/ms_pred/dag_pred/predict_smis.py`

An example of how to use ICEBERG for structural elucidation campaigns can be found at ``notebooks/iceberg_2025_arxiv/iceberg_demo_pubchem_elucidation.ipynb``.


### SCARF

SCARF models trained in two parts: a prefix tree generator and an intensity predictor. The pipeline for training and evaluating this model can be accessed in `run_scripts/scarf_model/`. The internal pipeline used to conduct experiments can be followed below:

1. *Train scarf model*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/01_run_scarf_gen_train.sh`
2. *Sweep number of prefixes to generate*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/02_sweep_scarf_gen_thresh.py`  
3. *Use model 1 to predict model 2 training set*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/03_scarf_gen_predict.sh`   
4. *Train intensity model*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/04_train_scarf_inten.sh`
5. *Make and evaluate intensity predictions*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/05_predict_form_inten.py`
6. *Run retrieval*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/06_run_retrieval.py`  
7. *Time scarf*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/07_time_scarf.py`  
8. *Export scarf forms* `run_scripts/scarf_model/08_export_forms.py`


Instead of running in batched pipeline model, individual gen training, inten
training, and predict calls can be  made using the following scripts respectively:

1. `python src/ms_pred/scarf_pred/train_gen.py`
2. `python src/ms_pred/scarf_pred/train_inten.py`
3. `python src/ms_pred/scarf_pred/predict_smis.py`

MetFrag is a learning-free fragmentation method that is used for ranking candidate molecules w.r.t. mass spectra. To run MetFrag in our retrieval benchmark setting:

Download [MetFrag command line tool](https://github.com/ipb-halle/MetFragRelaunched/releases). It should look like

```
MetFragCommandLine-X.X.X.jar  # We used 2.5.6 for benchmarking
```

Make prediction:

```


## Analysis <a name="analysis"></a>

Analysis scripts can be found in `analysis` for evaluating both formula
predictios `analysis/form_pred_eval.py` and spectra predictions
`analysis/spec_pred_eval.py`.

Additional analyses used for figure generation were conducted in `notebooks/`.

## Structural elucidation <a name="elucidation"></a>

Forward models could be applied for structural elucidation tasks with a set of candidate structures. An example workflow by taking all PubChem structures with the same chemical formula is shown in [``notebooks/iceberg_2025_arxiv/iceberg_demo_pubchem_elucidation.ipynb``](notebooks/iceberg_2025_arxiv/iceberg_demo_pubchem_elucidation.ipynb). In this example, ICEBERG predicts simulated spectra for all candidates, then all candidates are ranked based on their entropy similarities to the experimental spectrum.
