ICEBERG predicts spectra at the level of molecular fragments, whereas SCARF predicts spectra at the level of chemical formula. In order to fairly compare various spectra models, we implement a number of baselines and alternative models using equivalent settings across models (i.e., same covariates, hyeprparmaeter sweeps for each, etc.):

```
Installation will take ~5 minutes.

Note: if you are not using GPU, please comment the CUDA-based packages in ``envorinment.yaml``.

## Demo <a name="demo"></a>
A demo of how to use mass spectrum predictors (ICEBERG as an example) for structural elucidation campaigns can be found at [``notebooks/iceberg_2025_biorxiv/iceberg_demo_pubchem_elucidation.ipynb``](notebooks/iceberg_2025_biorxiv/iceberg_demo_pubchem_elucidation.ipynb).

Please go through the following prerequisites to run the demo:
* Clone the repository ``git clone https://github.com/coleygroup/ms-pred.git``.
* Start a jupyter notebook server (by ``jupyter notebook``), and navigate to ``notebooks/iceberg_2025_biorxiv/iceberg_demo_pubchem_elucidation.ipynb`` in the web UI.
* Get pretrained ICEBERG model weights.
    * You can either train the model by yourself (following instructions below);
    * Or if you have an NSIT'20 license (or newer), you can [email the maintainer with a proof of license](mailto:runzhong@mit.edu?subject=Inquiry%20of%20pretrianed%20ICEBERG%20on%20NIST20&body=My%20organization%20has%20a%20NIST'20%20(or%20newer)%20license%20and%20I%20would%20like%20to%20receive%20pretrained%20weights%20of%20ICEBERG%20on%20NIST'20.%20Please%20find%20the%20proof%20of%20purchase%20as%20attached.)
* Update [``the configuration file``](configs/iceberg/iceberg_elucidation.yaml) based your local setting. Change ``python_path`` to your Python excutiable, and update ``gen_ckpt`` and ``inten_ckpt`` to the path of your pretrained models.
    * When you have a GPU with smaller RAM, set smaller numbers for ``batch_size`` and ``num_workers`` to fit the model into GPU RAM (``batch_size: 8``, ``num_workers: 6`` tested on NVIDIA RTX 4070M 8GB; ``batch_size: 8``, ``num_workers: 12`` tested on NVIDIA RTX A5000 24GB).
    * CPU-only inference is also feasible if you set ``cuda_devices: None``.
 
Running the demo takes <2 minutes with a regular desktop GPU.

## Data <a name="data"></a>

> We are retiring the support of the NPLIB1 dataset (also referred as CANOPUS sometimes) in the main branch. 
> You can checkout to the [``iceberg_analychem_2024`` branch](https://github.com/coleygroup/ms-pred/tree/iceberg_analychem_2024)
> with the legacy code that supports NPLIB1.

``nist20`` is a commercial dataset available for purchase through [several vendors worldwide](https://chemdata.nist.gov/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=chemdata:distributors).
Given the scale of effort required to purchase samples, run experiments, and collect such a large amount of spectra,
and that NIST‚Äô20 is the only database where all spectra have collision energy annotations, this dataset is a reasonable investment in mass spectrum-related research in the
absence of a thorough open-source replacement. 

After your purchase of NIST, export the raw data as ``.SDF``. A detailed instruction on NIST'20 could be found [here](https://github.com/Roestlab/massformer?tab=readme-ov-file#exporting-the-nist-data) 
(select ``.SDF`` in output format). The code to process raw data could be found at ``reformat_nist_lcmsms_sdf.py`` in [this repo](https://github.com/rogerwwww/ms-data-parser).
Once the dataset is processed, move the files to ``ms-pred/data/spec_datasets/nist20`` and make sure it looks like
```
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nist20
 ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ labels.tsv
 ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mgf_files
 ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ spec_files.hdf5
 ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ splits
```


### SCARF Processing

Data should then be assigned to subformulae files using
`data_scripts/forms/assign_subformulae.py`, which will preprocess the data. We
produce two fragment versions of the molecule, `magma_subform_50` and
`no_subform`. The former strictly labels subformula based upon smiles structure
and the latter is permissive and allows all entries to pass.

```
. data_scripts/all_assign_subform.sh
```


### ICEBERG Processing

In addition to building processed subformulae, to train ICEBERG, we must
annotate substructures and create a labeled dataset over the breakage process, 
which we do with the MAGMa algorithm.

This can be done with the following script, specifying an appropriate dataset:

```

. data_scripts/dag/run_magma.sh

```

To get the PubChem-SMILES mapping that's required for contrastive finetuning, 
please download [pubchem_formulae_inchikey.hdf5](https://zenodo.org/records/15529765/files/pubchem_formulae_inchikey.hdf5)
and place it at ``data/pubchem/pubchem_formulae_inchikey.hdf5`` 
You don't need this if you decide to skip contrastive finetuning.


### Retrieval

To conduct retrieval experiments, libraries of smiles must be created. A PubChem
library is converted and each chemical formula is mapped to (smiles, inchikey)
pairs. Subsets are selected for evaluation.  Making formula subsets takes longer
(on the order of several hours, even parallelized) as it requires converting
each molecule in PubChem to a mol / InChI. 

```

source data_scripts/pubchem/01_download_smiles.sh
python data_scripts/pubchem/02_make_formula_subsets.py
python data_scripts/pubchem/03_dataset_subset.py --dataset-labels data/spec_datasets/nist20/labels.tsv # for nist20 dataset
python data_scripts/pubchem/04_make_retrieval_lists.py

```

 
## Experiments <a name="experiments"></a>

### ICEBERG

ICEBERG is our recommended model with a 40% top-1 retrieval accuracy with [M+H]+, benchmarked on the NIST'20 dataset. 
ICEBERG is trained in two parts: a learned fragment generator and an intensity predictor. The pipeline for training and evaluating this model can be accessed in `run_scripts/iceberg/`. 
There is an all-in-one script ``run_scripts/iceberg/run_all.sh`` that trains the up-to-date version of ICEBERG on NIST'20 dataset described in Wang et al. (2025). 
The archived version released with [Goldman et al. (2024)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13136) is at the [``iceberg_analychem_2024`` branch](https://github.com/coleygroup/ms-pred/tree/iceberg_analychem_2024).
The internal pipeline used to conduct experiments can be followed below:

1. *Train dag model*: `run_scripts/iceberg/01_run_dag_gen_train.sh`   
2. *Sweep over the number of fragments to generate*: `run_scripts/iceberg/02_sweep_gen_thresh.py`     
3. *Use model 1 to predict model 2 training set*: `run_scripts/iceberg/03_run_dag_gen_predict.sh`   
4. *Train intensity model, including contrastive training*: `run_scripts/iceberg/04_train_dag_inten.sh`   
5. *Make and evaluate intensity predictions*: `run_scripts/iceberg/05_predict_dag_inten.py`  
6. *Run retrieval*: `run_scripts/iceberg/06_run_retrieval.py`

> The above scripts will only run for split_1_rnd1 (random split, seed=1), which is suitable if you want to train your own ICEBERG for structural elucidation applications.
> 
> If you want to replicate our reported result with random + scaffold splits and 3 random seeds, please uncomment
> all entries in the following files
> * ``configs/iceberg/*.yaml``
> * ``run_scripts/iceberg/02_sweep_gen_thresh.py``
> * ``run_scripts/iceberg/05_predict_dag_inten.py``
> * ``run_scripts/iceberg/06_run_retrieval.py``

> You need two GPUs with at least 24GB RAM to train ICEBERG (we used NVIDIA A5000 for development). If you are trying to
> train the model on a smaller GPU, try cutting down the batch size and skipping the contrastive 
> finetuning step. Note that changing training parameters will affect the model's performance.

Instead of running in batched pipeline model, individual gen training, inten
training, and predict calls can be  made using the following scripts respectively:

1. `python src/ms_pred/dag_pred/train_gen.py`
2. `python src/ms_pred/dag_pred/train_inten.py`
3. `python src/ms_pred/dag_pred/predict_smis.py`

An example of how to use ICEBERG for structural elucidation campaigns can be found at ``notebooks/iceberg_2025_biorxiv/iceberg_demo_pubchem_elucidation.ipynb``.

### MARASON

MARASON is trained in two parts: a learned fragment generator (the same as the one in ICEBERG) and an RAG-based intensity predictor. The pipeline for training and evaluating this model can be accessed in `run_scripts/marason/`. 
There is an all-in-one script ``run_scripts/marason/run_all.sh`` that trains the up-to-date version of MARASON on NIST'20 and MassSpecGym dataset. 
The internal pipeline used to conduct experiments can be followed below:

1. *Train dag model*: `run_scripts/marason/01_run_marason_gen_train.sh`   
2. *Sweep over the number of fragments to generate*: `run_scripts/marason/02_sweep_gen_thresh.py`     
3. *Use model 1 to predict model 2 training set*: `run_scripts/marason/03_run_marason_gen_predict.sh`   
4. *Train intensity model*: `run_scripts/marason/04_train_marason_inten.sh`   
5. *Make and evaluate intensity predictions*: `run_scripts/marason/05_predict_marason_inten.py`  
6. *Run retrieval*: `run_scripts/marason/06_run_retrieval.sh`

> The above scripts will only run for split_1_rnd1 (random split, seed=1), which is suitable if you want to train your own MARASON for structural elucidation applications.
> 
> If you want to replicate our reported result with random + scaffold splits and 3 random seeds, please uncomment
> all entries in the following files
> * ``configs/marason/*.yaml``
> * ``run_scripts/marason/02_sweep_gen_thresh.py``
> * ``run_scripts/marason/05_predict_dag_inten.py``
> * ``run_scripts/marason/06_run_retrieval.py``

> Note that since the reference-target pairs can be pre-computed, you can save the computed pairs to a given directory by setting `save-reference` 
> to true and `reference-dir` to the desired directory in `configs/marason/marason_inten_train_nist.yaml` and 
> `configs/marason/marason_inten_train_msg_allev_entropy.yaml`. 
> Once the files are stored, you can load the precomputed pairs by setting `load-reference` to true in the corresponding config files 
> and skip the retrieval process.

> You need two GPUs with at least 24GB RAM to train MARASON (we used NVIDIA A5000 for development). If you are trying to
> train the model on a smaller GPU, try cutting down the hidden_size to 256. 
> Note that changing training parameters will affect the model performance.

Instead of running in batched pipeline model, individual gen training, inten
training, and predict calls can be made using the following scripts respectively:

1. `python src/ms_pred/marason/train_gen.py`
2. `python src/ms_pred/marason/train_inten.py`
3. `python src/ms_pred/marason/predict_smis.py`

You can use `python launcher_scripts/run_from_config.py configs/marason/marason_inten_test_nist.yaml` to generate relevant analysis and visualizations in the MARASON paper. You can draw the matching pattern and the spectra visualization by setting `draw` and `plot-spec` to be true respectively. If you want to do the similarity-grouped analysis described in the paper, set `draw` and `plot-spec` to be false. The bootstrap analysis for MassSpecGym retrieval task can be carried out by running `src/ms_pred/marason/bootstrap.py`.

### SCARF

SCARF models trained in two parts: a prefix tree generator and an intensity predictor. The pipeline for training and evaluating this model can be accessed in `run_scripts/scarf_model/`. The internal pipeline used to conduct experiments can be followed below:

1. *Train scarf model*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/01_run_scarf_gen_train.sh`
2. *Sweep number of prefixes to generate*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/02_sweep_scarf_gen_thresh.py`  
3. *Use model 1 to predict model 2 training set*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/03_scarf_gen_predict.sh`   
4. *Train intensity model*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/04_train_scarf_inten.sh`
5. *Make and evaluate intensity predictions*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/05_predict_form_inten.py`
6. *Run retrieval*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/06_run_retrieval.py`  
7. *Time scarf*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/07_time_scarf.py`  
8. *Export scarf forms* `run_scripts/scarf_model/08_export_forms.py`


Instead of running in batched pipeline model, individual gen training, inten
training, and predict calls can be  made using the following scripts respectively:

1. `python src/ms_pred/scarf_pred/train_gen.py`
2. `python src/ms_pred/scarf_pred/train_inten.py`
3. `python src/ms_pred/scarf_pred/predict_smis.py`

MetFrag is a learning-free fragmentation method that is used for ranking candidate molecules w.r.t. mass spectra. To run MetFrag in our retrieval benchmark setting:

Download [MetFrag command line tool](https://github.com/ipb-halle/MetFragRelaunched/releases). It should look like

```
MetFragCommandLine-X.X.X.jar  # We used 2.5.6 for benchmarking
```

Make prediction:

. run_scripts/metfrag/process_metfrag.py

```

### Freq baselines

As an addiitonal baseline to compare to the generative portion of our scarf
(thread), we include frequency baselines for generating form subsets:

. run_scripts/freq_baseline/predict_rand.py

```


## Analysis <a name="analysis"></a>

Analysis scripts can be found in `analysis` for evaluating both formula
predictios `analysis/form_pred_eval.py` and spectra predictions
`analysis/spec_pred_eval.py`.

Additional analyses used for figure generation were conducted in `notebooks/`.

## Structural elucidation <a name="elucidation"></a>

Forward models could be applied for structural elucidation tasks with a set of candidate structures. An example workflow by taking all PubChem structures with the same chemical formula is shown in [``notebooks/iceberg_2025_biorxiv/iceberg_demo_pubchem_elucidation.ipynb``](notebooks/iceberg_2025_biorxiv/iceberg_demo_pubchem_elucidation.ipynb). In this example, ICEBERG predicts simulated spectra for all candidates, then all candidates are ranked based on their entropy similarities to the experimental spectrum.
