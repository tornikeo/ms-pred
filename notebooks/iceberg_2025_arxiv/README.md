# ICEBERG notebooks for Wang et al. Arxiv (2025)

Notebooks under this directory are accompanying 
Wang et al. "Neural Spectral Prediction for Structure Elucidation with Tandem Mass Spectrometry". Arxiv (2025).

-------------------------

* We recommend start working with ``demo_pubchem_elucidation.ipynb`` for your project. This notebook contains the 
example reported in the paper on the identification of GABA-Arg, with step-by-step instructions.
* The other notebooks are meant to help reproduce the figures:
  * ``iceberg_fig_qualitative.ipynb`` plots the qualitative study of bond-breaking
  * ``iceberg_fig_quantitative.ipynb`` plots the quantitative results
  * ``iceberg_fig_visual_msms.ipynb`` plots all the visualizations of MS/MS
  * ``iceberg_pesticide_kinetics.ipynb`` plots the kinetics of carbendazim 
  * ``iceberg_pooled_cn_coupling.ipynb`` plots the results for the pooled C-N coupling experiment
  * ``iceberg_withanolide_elucidation.ipynb`` plots the results for the biosynthesis pathway elucidation for withanolides
